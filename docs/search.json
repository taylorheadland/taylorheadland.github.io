    "text": "I’m a PhD student studying urban raptor ecology in Adelaide, South Australia. My project focuses on the Nankeen Kestrel, a small falcon that inhabits urban and rural areas, and how its ecology differs across the urban/rural gradient. I enjoy birding, and particularly enjoy searching for birds of prey. I;m passionate about using statistical programming (e.g. R) combined with citizen science observations (e.g. eBird, Birdata) to find patterns and trends of Australian raptor populations to aid in their conservation."

Recent evidence has demonstrated the impact of drones on animal behavior, but the response of nocturnal animals to drone flight remains unknown.

All wombats flown over during both day and night flights responded behaviorally to the presence of drones. The response differed based on time of day. The most common night-time behavior elicited by drone flight was retreat, compared to stationary alertness behavior observed for daytime drone flights. The behavioral response of the wombats increased as flight altitude decreased. The marked difference of behavior between day and night indicates that this has implications for studies using drones. The behavior observed during flights was altered due to the presence of the drone, and therefore, shrewd study design is important (i.e., acclimation period to drone flight).

    "text": "2023\nHeadland, T., Colombelli-Négrel, D., Callaghan, C.T. et al. Smaller Australian raptors have greater urban tolerance. Sci Rep 13, 11559 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38493-z\nAbstract\nUrbanisation is occurring around the world at a rapid rate and is generally associated with negative impacts on biodiversity at local, regional, and global scales. Examining the behavioural response profiles of wildlife to urbanisation helps differentiate between species that do or do not show adaptive responses to changing landscapes and hence are more or less likely to persist in such environments. Species-specific responses to urbanisation are poorly understood in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere, where most of the published literature is focussed. This is also true for raptors, despite their high diversity and comparably high conservation concern in the Southern Hemisphere, and their critical role within ecosystems as bioindicators of environmental health. Here, we explore this knowledge gap using community science data sourced from eBird to investigate the urban tolerance of 24 Australian raptor species at a continental scale. We integrated eBird data with a global continuous measure of urbanisation, artificial light at night (ALAN), to derive an urban tolerance index, ranking species from positive to negative responses according to their tolerance of urban environments. We then gathered trait data from the published literature to assess whether certain traits (body mass, nest substrate, habitat type, feeding guild, and migratory status) were associated with urban tolerance. Body size was negatively associated with urban tolerance, as smaller raptors had greater urban tolerance than larger raptors. Out of the 24 species analysed, 13 species showed tolerance profiles for urban environments (positive response), and 11 species showed avoidance profiles for urban environments (negative response). The results of this study provide impetus to conserve native habitat and improve urban conditions for larger-bodied raptor species to conserve Australian raptor diversity in an increasingly urbanised world."

    "text": "Throughout the time that I’ve been undertaking my PhD I’ve gained skills in data science and statistical programming, particularly with the language R. I started learning R during my Honours year, but have been able to take it to the next level with my PhD in terms of the complexity and scope of use. Although daunting at times, learning to code has been the most enjoyable part of my PhD and something that I look forward to hopefully doing as part of a job sometime in the future!\nIn this article I’m going to estimate the relative abundance of the Wedge-tailed Eagle in Australia using data from the community science platform, eBird. This platform boasts more than ___ records of birds across the globe, and is an invaluable conservation resource to study bird populations and how they change across time and space. I decided on the Wedge-tailed Eagle, because as a birder that specifically studies raptors, you can’t get much cooler than an Eagle!\nThis analysis largely follows the work of Matt Strimas-Mackey and the wonderful work that he and the eBird team at Cornell University in America put together in the form of a best practices guide when working with eBird data. This has been an extremely helpful resources throughout my PhD and I couldn’t have done a few of my chapters without it! Here is a link to the resource: https://ebird.github.io/ebird-best-practices/\nEnough chit chat, lets get to the analysis!\nFirst up, lets load the packages required for the analysis.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(blockCV)\nlibrary(auk)\nlibrary(ebirdst)\nlibrary(auk)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(mccf1)\nlibrary(ranger)\nlibrary(scam)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)"
