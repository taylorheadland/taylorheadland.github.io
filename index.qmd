I'm a PhD student studying urban raptor ecology in Adelaide, South Australia. My project focuses on the Nankeen Kestrel, a small falcon that inhabits urban and rural areas, and how its ecology differs across the urban/rural gradient. I enjoy birding, and particularly enjoy searching for birds of prey. I;m passionate about using statistical programming (e.g. R) combined with citizen science observations (e.g. eBird, Birdata) to find patterns and trends of Australian raptor populations to aid in their conservation.
